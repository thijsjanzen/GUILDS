Description: A collection of sampling formulas for the unified neutral
    model of biogeography and biodiversity. Alongside the sampling
    formulas, it includes methods to perform maximum likelihood
    optimization of the sampling formulas, methods to generate data given
    the neutral model, and methods to estimate the expected species
    abundance distribution. Sampling formulas included in the GUILDS
    package are the Etienne Sampling Formula (Etienne 2005), the guild
    sampling formula, where guilds are assumed to differ in dispersal
    ability (Janzen et al. 2015), and the guilds sampling formula
    conditioned on guild size (Janzen et al. 2015).
